###Responsive Website Application Foundation

poseidon is meant to be a structural foundation for
website applications.

The idea is to provide front-end engineers with the ability
to implement responsive patterns through simple class changes.
Having said that, poseidon is not meant to be a fit for all
applications or websites.
